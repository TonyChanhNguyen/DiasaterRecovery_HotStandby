	"content": "Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions. It replicates your data with no impact on database performance, enables fast local reads with low latency in each region, and provides disaster recovery from region-wide outages. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a secondary region to take full read-write responsibilities in under a minute.\nWith an Aurora global database, there are two different approaches to failover depending on the scenario.\nFailover – Use this approach to recover from an unplanned outage. With this approach, you perform a cross-Region failover to one of the secondary DB clusters in your Aurora global database. The RPO for this approach is typically a non-zero value measured in seconds. The amount of data loss depends on the Aurora global database replication lag across the AWS Regions at the time of the failure.\nSwitchover – This operation was previously called \u0026ldquo;managed planned failover.\u0026rdquo; Use this approach for controlled scenarios, such as operational maintenance and other planned operational procedures. Because this feature synchronizes secondary DB clusters with the primary before making any other changes, RPO is 0 (no data loss).\nSwitchover, is showcased in Warm Standby workshop.\nFor this workshop we will be doing a Failover.\n  Go to RDS in N. California (us-west-1) region.\n  Look at the pilot-global Global database. Notice how you have pilot-primary a Primary cluster in us-east-1 which has your Writer instance and pilot-secondary a Secondary cluster in us-west-1 which has your Reader instance.   Select pilot-global cluster.\n  Click on Actions.\n  Choose Switch over or fail over global database under Actions.   Choose Failover (allow data loss).\n  At New primary cluster feature, select pilot-secondary.\n  Input confirm.\n  Then, click on Confirm.   It will take you several minutes to promote Secondary database to Primary.   When the failover is complete, notice the changes. The Primary cluster is now in us-west-1 which has our Writer instance and the Secondary Cluster is now in us-east-1 which has our Reader instance.   "

Pilot Light disaster recovery strategy has Recovery Point Objective(RPO) / Recovery Time Objective (RTO) within tens of minutes. For the pilot light strategy secondary region, the data is live and core infrastructure is provisioned, but the services are either idle or absent.\nYour application is currently deployed in the primary region N. Virginia (us-east-1). N. California (us-west-1) will be your secondary.\nYour test application is Unishop. It is a Spring Boot Java application deployed on a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance using a public subnet. Your datastore is an Amazon Aurora MySQL database with a frontend written using bootstrap and hosted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).\nThis module takes advantage of Amazon Machine Images (AMI) which you will use to launch your Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon Aurora Global Database to replicate your Amazon Aurora MySQL data to your secondary region.\nCloudFormation will be used to configure the infrastructure and deploy the application. Provisioning your infrastructure with infrastructure as code (IaC) methodologies is a best practice. CloudFormation is an easy way to speed up cloud provisioning with infrastructure as code.\nBecause this workload has only one EC2 instance that is deployed in only one Availability Zone, this architecture does not meet the AWS Well Architected Framework best practices for running highly available production applications but suffices for this workshop.\n\rContent  Introduce Preparation  2.1 S3 access 2.2 Primary region 2.3 Secondary region 2.4 Verify website   Prepare secondary region Failover  4.1 Aurora 4.2 EC2 4.3 Verify failover   Cleanup resources  "
